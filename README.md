# BUWwypozyczenia

The aim of this project is to programatically access, store in a database and then analyze data on my checked out items (books and locker keys). 

I used selenium framework in order to programatically log in, move and log out from the Library's (BUW) website. The beautifulsoup module was used for getting the data from the HTML structure.
